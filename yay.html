            You’re not easy-going, but you’re passionate, and that’s good. 
            And when you get upset about the little things, I think that 
            I’m pretty good about making you feel better about that. 
            And that’s good too. So, they can say that you’re high maintenance, 
            but it’s okay, because I like…maintaining you. 🤧🥺
